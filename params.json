Newsfeed eradicator for Chrome was originally created by [Jordwest](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator). \r\n\r\nI appreciated the Chrome extension a lot, but I use safari for it's power management. I did not replace the newsfeed with quotes as they got annoying after a while. It only removes the newsfeed.\r\n\r\nDownload here: [Safari Extension](https://github.com/AntonOsika/newsfeed-eradicator/blob/master/Newsfeed-Eradicator.safariextz?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nPlease mail me any opinions anton.osika@gmail.com, or submit them as issues on Github.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
