### Newsfeed Eradicator for Safari.
Newsfeed eradicator for Chrome was originally created by Jordwest [Open Source](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator). 

I used and liked his Chrome extension a lot, but I like safari for it's power management. I did not replace the newsfeed with quotes as they got annoying after a while. The extension only removes the newsfeed.

Please go ahead and do pull requests for new improvements.
