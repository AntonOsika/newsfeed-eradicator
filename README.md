### Newsfeed Eradicator for Safari.
Newsfeed eradicator for Chrome was originally created by Jordwest [Open Source](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator). 

I used and liked his Chrome extension, but I like safari for it's power management. I did not replace the newsfeed with quotes as they got annoying after a while. The extension only removes the newsfeed.

I don't have a safari developer account anymore so will not update the extension. 
It can however be built and added to safari manually if you clone this repo.

Also you can check out https://github.com/maxfriedrich/quiet-facebook for a simpler solution.
