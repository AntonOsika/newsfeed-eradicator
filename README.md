# Newsfeed Eradicator for Safari.
Newsfeed eradicator for Chrome was originally created by Jordwest [Open Source](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator). 

I used and liked his Chrome extension, but I like safari for it's power management.

## Update

I don't have a safari developer account anymore so I will not update the extension.
